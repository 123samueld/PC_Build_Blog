<p id="text_">
    I've been hugely impressed by the 'Grimdark' style, which I define as a fusion of Medieval Central European, pseudo Christian, sci-fi, bio-cybernetic, feudal, and nationalist. It's bold, grand, ornate, and richly fascinating. The aesthetic has a dark and mysterious atmosphere, blending historical architecture, futuristic and biological elements. 
    Think <a href="https://hrgiger.com/" target="_blank">HR Giger</a> but non-sexual and a lot more skulls.

    During my initial exploration of this theme, I sketched various 'hanging' ornaments in the pseudo-gothic style, inspired by Edinburgh. 'Pseudo-gothic' refers to an imitation of the gothic style that pays no heed to the engineering priciples, yet still carries a similar visual character of the style.
</p>
<p id="text_">
    The defining feature of this style is its reliance on compressive forces, which were used to build the majestic cathedrals of medieval Europe. These structures followed distinctly different design principles from the castles of the time. Castles, designed for military defense and counter-seige craft, were built to be incredibly robust. With walls several meters thick, castle architecture is stout with dark interiors. Their sheer power and strength made them the superweapons of their era, maximising for the intimidation factor not beauty and elegance. 
</p>
<p id="text_">
    The Opus Francigenum style, or 'French Work' (Gothic) emerged as a dominant form of architecture in the 12th starting in Frankish lands then rapidly spread across Christendom by highly saught after artisans: master builders, iron workers, stone masons, carpenters, glass makers and a veritible army of support workers. Over ~300 years and much trial and error, architects perfected the creative use of compressive forces to create towering, airy structures. These buildings stood as feats of engineering, incorporating geometry that still holds up nearly a millennium later. Form and function in glorious synergy.
</p>
<p id="text_">
    This style introduced iconic geometric elements such as the lancet arch, reinforced buttresses, triangular peaks with a ~3.5:1 ratio, and heavy pinnacle stones. Although these features are beautiful they're not ornamental—they are physical manifestations of the underlying physical principles that have allowed these majestic edifices to remain standing as ancient heirlooms for the European peoples.  
</p>
<p id="text_">
    While Gothic architecture relies heavily on compression, objects that 'hang'—like chandelliers, candle holders, insence sensors—depend on tension, the polar opposite of compression. This contrast in forces reveals the unique dynamics in architectural design.
</p>
<p id="text_">
    Hanging chains were used by master designers, engineers and architects as an analogue finite element analysis simulation. Once a design solution had been found the model would be inverted then built, so "hanging gothic" design is literally upside down.

    With lots of assistance from my brother, PC components were selected, analysed, re-analysed, debated and purchased. The goal was to create a system with low initial specifications but decent upgrade potential. The minimum requirements for the AI game engine project is a decent CPU and pretty much any discreet GPU (not an APU). With generous support, the minimum requirements were exceeded and this will turn out to be a decent gaming/game dev machine. The motherboard and power supply were chosen so this setup can be upgraded to a small domestic AI server to practice and learn about multiplexing AI tasks across multiple GPUs. All in, for the price tag it's a very nice setup and greatly exceeds the minimum requirement of a basic machine to learn on. Thank you to my brother for that assistance, and sorry for not getting a 1080!

<p id="text_">
    Many of the structural/skeletal/connective components are from non-computing fields, like 2 ton automotive tow chains, malleable iron pipework, garden awning cables etc. The heavy metal components and some of the 2nd hand components needed cleaning and even some deburring before they could be allowed to come in contact with new, sealed computer parts. With machined components, surface preparation is everything so isopropyl alcohol wipes and acetone were used clean and degrease the heavy metal and sharp edges were deburred. Also my living room/office space has a severe dust problem, so all extra fabric was removed from the room and the floor was wet cleaned multiple times across the duration of the project. This is far from a clean room setup but makes as best as possible. Electronics were always handled with nitrile gloves to avoid human contaminates and components were left sealed in packaging until the last moment before installation, or occasional removal during the design phase.
