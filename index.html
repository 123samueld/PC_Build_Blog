<h2 id="intro-heading text_">Inspiration</h2>
<p id="text_">
    I've been hugely impressed by the 'Grimdark' style, which I define as a fusion of 
    Medieval Central European, pseudo Christian, sci-fi, bio-cybernetic, feudal, and nationalist. 
    It's imposing, grand, ornate, and richly fascinating. The aesthetic creates a dark and foreboading atmosphere, 
    blending historical styling with futuristic and biological accents. 
    Think <a href="https://hrgiger.com/" target="_blank">HR Giger</a> but non-sexual and a ton more skulls.
</p>
<p id="text_">
    During my initial exploration of this theme, I sketched various 'hanging' ornaments in the pseudo-gothic style, 
    inspired by architecture and ornaments from across the City of Edinburgh. 
    Only 'pseudo' gothic because these examples are an imitation of the gothic style 
    which pay no heed to the engineering priciples, yet still carry similar visual character of the original movement.
</p>
<p id="text_">
    The defining feature of this style is its reliance on compressive forces, which were used to build the 
    majestic cathedrals of medieval Europe. These structures followed distinctly different design principles from the castles 
    of the time. Castles, designed for military defense and counter-seige craft, were built to be incredibly robust. 
    With walls several meters thick, castle architecture is very stout which results in dark interiors. 
    Their sheer power and strength made them the superweapons of their era, maximising for the intimidation factor 
    not beauty nor elegance. 
</p>
<p id="text_">
    The Opus Francigenum style, or 'French Work' (Gothic design) emerged as a dominant form of architecture in the
    12th starting in Frankish lands then rapidly spread across Christendom by highly saught after artisans: 
    master builders, iron workers, stone masons, carpenters, glass makers, renderers and a veritible army of support workers. 
    Over ~300 years and much trial and error, architects perfected the creative use of compressive forces to create 
    towering, airy structures. These buildings stood as monolithic feats of engineering, incorporating geometry that 
    still holds up nearly a millennium later. 
    These craftsmen interwove form and function into a glorious, inseparable synergy.
</p>
<p id="text_">
    This style introduced iconic geometric elements such as the lancet arch, reinforced buttresses, 
    triangular peaks with a ~3.5:1 ratio, and heavy pinnacle stones. 
    Although these features are beautiful they're not ornamental—they are physical manifestations of the underlying 
    physical principles that have allowed these majestic edifices to remain standing as ancient heirlooms 
    belonging to the nations Europe.  
</p>
<p id="text_">
    While Gothic architecture relies heavily on compression, objects that 'hang'—like chandelliers, candle holders, 
    insence sensors, etc —depend on tension, the exact opposite of compression. 
    This contrast in forces reveals my dilemma in designing a "hanging Gothic PC case".
</p>
<p id="text_">
    Hanging chains were used by master designers, engineers and architects as an early form of 
    "<a href="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fimg.freepik.com%2Fpremium-photo%2Fdetailed-analysis-bridge-structure-using-finite-element-analysis-fea-mesh-stress-distribution_1105246-1054.jpg&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=10022ae60024700c6f85b38bbebfb960661410483d562d02507cfe85d8116483" target="_blank">
    finite element analysis</a>" simulation. 
    Once a design solution had been found the model would be inverted then built, 
    so a hanging gothic design is quite literally upside down. Learn more about this interesting process 
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRv_syz2DAc" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>
<p id="text_">
    My solution to work around this apparent design contradiction is to create 1 foundation type structure 
    which is suspended by strong chains from the ceiling. From this foundation every other component 
    is placed on top and so under the conventional compressive forces found in gothic design. 
    Anything designed and built from scratch is very complex and resource intensive. 
    So to simplify the process a little this "hanging foundation" design is able to constrain the design choices 
    to mostly compressive forces after the suspended foundation is built. For me, 
    the extra effort this design choice entails is worth it. 
    This choice ensures the PC and it's case will not only appear gothic design in form, 
    but also be gothic in it's structural function. Form and function interwoven in harmonious synergy.
</p>
<p id="text_">
    This attention to synergetic detail is not only applied to the main, most visable, external components 
    but is also applied to internal components. Connective braces, brakets and clasps likewise serve well in both form and function.
    The beautiful latticework of these connective components serves to make the internal strucutre not only more ridged due to cross bracing, 
    but also more elastic allowing for greater shock absorbing properties if the PC case happens to get bumped or dropped. 
    Because the lattice work is so fine it only contributes a small amount of additional mass while adding huge gains in form and function.

<p id="text_">
    With lots of assistance from my brother, the electronic PC components were selected, analysed, re-analysed, 
    debated and purchased. The goal was to create a system with low initial specifications but decent upgrade potential. 
    My next project will be a game engine oriented around AI training. The minimum requirements for that project are a CPU with  +4 cores and a 
    GPU with 6GB of VRAM. With generous support, the minimum requirements were easily exceeded and this will turn out 
    to be a gaming/game dev machine far beyond my initial intention. The motherboard and power supply were chosen so this setup can be 
    upgraded to become a very small domestic AI server to practice and learn about multiplexing AI tasks across multiple GPUs.
    It won't be sufficient to run good LLMs at 20tps inferencing rates, but will be very sufficient for my needs in learning and building very small AI models. 
    All in, for the price tag it's a very nice setup and greatly exceeds the minimum requirement of a basic machine 
    to learn on. Thank you to my brother for that assistance, and sorry for not getting a GTX1080!

<p id="text_">
    Many of the structural/skeletal/connective components are from non-computing fields, 
    like a 2 ton automotive tow chain, malleable iron pipework, garden awning cables and connections etc. 
    The heavy metal components and some of the 2nd hand components needed cleaning and even some needed
    deburring before they could be allowed to come in contact with clean, sealed computer electronics. 
    Some of the heavy metal components had to be machined and surface preparation is everything.
    Sharp edges and manufacturing artifacts were thoroghly deburred and sanded, then isopropyl alcohol wipes 
    and acetone solvent were used to clean, degrease and remove many particulates from the heavy metal components.
    The cleaning process was labourious but the steps were repeated many times (~3-7) until no further dirt was obseverd on a clean, 
    white alcohol wipe. 
</p>
<p id="text_">
    The workspace has a severe dust problem, so all extra fabric was removed from the 
    room and the carpet floor and horizontal surfaces were wet cleaned multiple times across the duration of the project. 
    This is far from a clean room setup but is the highest cleanliness possible with the resources available. 
    When handling electronics, nitrile gloves were used and the work station was set up on an anti-static mat. In addition 
    I was plugged into the anti-static circuit to further reduce any chance of a static overload in the electrical system. 
    All components were left sealed in packaging until the very last moment before installation, or minimal 
    removal during the design and testing phases. 
    Once the materials and workspace were prepared, the design and build phases commenced.

    Because the project is so complex, the comonents are placed in catagories inspired by anatomy. 
    Bones, Cartilage, Ligaments, Tendons etc. The underlying iron pipe structure is the toughest component and 
    is catagorised under "Venatus Ossificatrix", or "Venerable Matrix of Bones" in low gothic. 
    These are given added rigidity in their off-axes by ornate, 3D printed "Cartilagus" aka "cartilage". The 4 chains that hold up the whole 
    structure are "Tendo Ferrum" or "iron tendons". This catagorisation method allowed for great organisation across many complex systems 
    but without getting too distracted by the fun, creative process of coming up with new concepts and catagories, 
    just drawing on God's creation for inspiration instead.
</p>
<h3 id="sketches text_">Sketches</h3>
<p id="text_">
    To check the viability of a few ideas quickly, rough technical sketches were drawn. 
    They are 8:1 scale with moderate attention to accuracy, 
    to produce drawings that quite closely represent a full scale design and build phases. 
    This allowed for rapid, low cost, low risk testing of ideas. 
    Design concepts were tested against these simple paper models to debug design flaws 
    before they crept up in the full scale, expensive build. 
    This was a fast and cheap way to iterate though a few ideas until a design was found.
    This method is not a substitute for proper care and attention to detail during design, manufacturing and assembly,
    but is just a handy little tool in the engineers toolbox.

<h2 id="CAD-testing-heading text_">Testing and CAD</h2>
<h3 id="testing text_">Mass Testing</h3>
<p id="text_">
    Because the completed PC and case was projected to weigh +10kg, testing the key structural components was required.
    If any one key structural component were to fail, 
    it would be an expensive accident with little chance of recovery. 
    The mass of each of the main components was found and key components were tested at 
    ~300% their nominal load or to breaking, whichever would come first. 
    The testing and large saftey margin will allow for full peace of mind that the PC case will be mounted very securley. 
    Once the stress testing was complete the structural integrety of the device drew no further attention and energies
    could fully move on to other matters without fear.
</p>
<p id="text_">The mass of the main components were found to be:</p>
    <ul>
       <li id="text_">0.0kg: Medullum (fragile internal components like Motherboard, GPU, RAM, Memory etc)</li> 
       <li id="text_">0.0kg: Power Supply Unit</li>
       <li id="text_">0.0kg: Skeletal pipework and 3D printed cartilage</li>
       <li id="text_">0.0kg: Chain tendons and ligaments</li>
       <li id="text_">0.0kg: The Alveolus Machina (air filters and primary inlet fan system)</li>
       <li id="text_">0.0kg: Cranium (tough external elements)</li>
       <li id="text_">0.0.kg: Total</li>
    </ul>
<p id="text_">
    The key structural components were tested at 300% of their nominal load. 
    Exercise weights were used as a dummy test mass. 
    Before testing, the components were inspected to observe their pre-test condition.
    The key components were placed under load and left to sit for 24h under the excess strain. 
    After testing, the components were were inspected for signs of deformation. 
    The key components and the load tested were (ordered by max mass first to represent the orientation of tensile forces):
</p>
    <ul>
        <li id="text_">0.0kg: Wooden Ceiling Joists</li> 
        <li id="text_">0.0kg: Mounting bolts (4 bolts, 0.0kg each)</li> 
        <li id="text_">0.0kg: Mounting brackets (2 brackets, 0.0kg each) </li>
        <li id="text_">0.0kg: Chain tendons and ligaments (4 chain sections, 0.0kg each)</li>
        <li id="text_">0.0kg: Skeletal pipework</li>
        <li id="text_">0.0kg: 3D printed PLA cartilage</li>
    </ul>

<p id="text_">
    All the key components passed stress testing without any signs of deformation. 
    This was taken as an indication the components will comfortably stand up under 200% less mass 
    representing the strain the PC case will actually experience under normal conditions.
