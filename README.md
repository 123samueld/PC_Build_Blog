# Blog about building a Grimdark PC.

##Getting started

I've been wanting to build a new game engine with a neural net at it's core. The plan to accomplish this is to use the GPU partially for graphics rendering but also for running the NN during run time. I first attempted this but found my current machine had a graphics driver problem that could not be solved with only 1 machine. So with a combination of savings and gifts the resources for a 2nd machine were collected and the build has begun. However, since this is an enjoyable technical challenge, I've decided to build the PC case from scratch in the "Grimdark" style. This project is a rich blend of mechanical, structural and electrical engineering, fluid/thermal dynamics, artistic flair, creative problem solving and ironically hardly a single line of code whatsoever. This blog will cover the project as it proceeds over aproximitely the next 8 weeks.  

Once the project is wrapped up a fun build montage video will be produced to sum up the project and give it an entertaining twist.
